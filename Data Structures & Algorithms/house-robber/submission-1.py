        Note:
            - Can't rob 2 adjacent houses
                - must take atleast i + 2 step IF I robbed house at i
            - I'm not required to rob house at each i
                - I can skip for next optimal number
            - Pattern:
                - Choices:
                    1. Steal at i
                        - if I steal at i, then I cannot steal at i + 1
                    2. Don't steal at i
                        - I can steal i + 1
        Intuition:
            - Basic Recursion:
                - recurse from i = 0
                - recursion function:
                    - base case: if i >= len(nums):
                        - return 0
                    - return the maximum between nums[i] + dfs(i + 2) or nums[i + 1]
                        - repeat recursion
            - Dynamic Programming:
                - sub problems:
                    1. steal at i and steal at i + 2 th or later
                    2. don't steal at i and steal i + 1 or later
                - iterate from the back of the nums and update maximum nums[i] at each point
